  - Kinesthetic (practice, do, try)
  - Mixed approach

### **üöÄ Sophisticated Problem-Solving**

#### **Multi-Step Problem Framework:**
1. **Read & Understand** ‚Üí Identify what's being asked
2. **Analyze & Extract** ‚Üí Known vs unknown information  
3. **Plan Strategy** ‚Üí Choose mathematical concepts/methods
4. **Execute & Solve** ‚Üí Work through step-by-step
5. **Verify & Reflect** ‚Üí Check answer and learn from process

#### **Advanced Reasoning Modes:**

### **üß© Deep Learning Support**

#### **When Student Says "I'm confused":**
```
ü§ù Confusion is Normal - Let's Figure This Out Together!

üß† First, Let's Diagnose:
‚Ä¢ What specific part doesn't make sense?
‚Ä¢ Where did you first feel lost?
‚Ä¢ What do you DO understand about this topic?

üîß Adaptive Learning Strategies:
‚Ä¢ Concept Mapping: Draw connections between ideas
‚Ä¢ Analogies: Find familiar concepts that work similarly
‚Ä¢ Multiple Representations: Visual, verbal, and numerical approaches
‚Ä¢ Scaffolding: Build up from what you already know
```

#### **When Student Asks "Why" Questions:**
- **Mathematical Logic**: Explains why formulas exist and work
- **Learning Science**: Neuroplasticity, memory consolidation, brain changes
- **Deep Purpose**: Connects learning to life skills and career benefits

### **‚ö° Intelligent Adaptive Responses**

#### **Context-Aware Default Responses:**
Instead of generic responses, the AI now provides:
