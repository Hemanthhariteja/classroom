# Replace Existing Repository with New SIH Project

## üéØ Goal
Replace all files in your existing "RuralConnect Classroom" repository with your new enhanced SIH project files.

## üìã Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Find Your Exact Repository Name
1. Go to https://github.com/Hemanthhariteja
2. Look for your "RuralConnect Classroom" repository
3. Click on it and copy the exact repository URL from the browser address bar
4. The URL format will be: `https://github.com/Hemanthhariteja/EXACT_REPO_NAME`

### Step 2: Get Repository Clone URL
1. On your repository page, click the green **"Code"** button
2. Copy the HTTPS URL (it will look like: `https://github.com/Hemanthhariteja/REPO_NAME.git`)

### Step 3: Configure Remote and Push (Run These Commands)

Replace `EXACT_REPO_URL` with the URL you copied:

```powershell
# Navigate to your project directory
cd "d:\sih\project"

# Remove any existing remote (if configured)
git remote remove origin

# Add your repository as remote (replace with your actual URL)
git remote add origin EXACT_REPO_URL

# Force push to replace all existing files
git push -u origin main --force
```

### Example Commands (Replace URL):
```powershell
cd "d:\sih\project"
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/Hemanthhariteja/Your-Actual-Repo-Name.git
git push -u origin main --force
```
