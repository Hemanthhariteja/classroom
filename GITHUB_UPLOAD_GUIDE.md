# GitHub Upload Instructions

## Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub
1. Go to https://github.com/Hemanthhariteja
2. Click "New" or "+" > "New repository"
3. Set repository name: `sih-rural-classroom-platform` (or your preferred name)
4. Set description: "Smart India Hackathon - Rural Classroom Platform with WebRTC, AI assistance, and offline capabilities"
5. Keep it Public (recommended for showcase)
6. DO NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
7. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub
After creating the repository on GitHub, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd "d:\sih\project"

# Add GitHub as remote origin (replace with your actual repository URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/Hemanthhariteja/sih-rural-classroom-platform.git

# Push your code to main branch
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Alternative - If Repository Already Exists
If you already have a repository and want to push to it:

```bash
cd "d:\sih\project"
git remote add origin https://github.com/Hemanthhariteja/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 4: Verify Upload
After pushing, go to your GitHub repository URL and verify all files are uploaded.

## Your Repository is Ready! âœ…

Your local git repository is already configured with:
- âœ… Initial commit with all files
- âœ… Proper .gitignore file
- âœ… Comprehensive README.md
- âœ… Git user configured as "Hemanthhariteja"

2. Create GitHub Pages for documentation (optional)
3. Set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions (optional)
4. Enable GitHub Discussions for community feedback

## Important Notes:
- Make sure your GitHub repository is public if you want to showcase it
- The repository includes sensitive placeholder files (.env.example) - never commit actual .env files
- Consider adding a LICENSE file if you want to specify usage terms
- The README.md includes comprehensive documentation for setup and usage
